# Seismic Dark theme

This theme is dark and absolutely beautiful, it features a “sticky” customizable
menu. Sticky “featured” post, clean lines, with easy to read fonts. It also
supports six widgetized areas so you will be able to position your content just
how you want it. Like to post pictures? No problem, Seismic Dark has that
covered too. Seismic Dark theme supports custom image galleries so you can
really show of your pictures.

 * Sticky menu
 * Multiple widget areas
 * Custom image galleries

Don’t have much experience setting up a website? No problem, the Standard 
theme makes things very easy. If you would like help setting up the theme 
feel free to contact us.
